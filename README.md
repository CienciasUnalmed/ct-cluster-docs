# Church-Turing HPC Cluster User Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for our High-Performance Computing (HPC)
cluster. This resource is designed to help researchers, students, and staff
effectively utilize our computational resources for their research and academic
projects.

## Overview

Our HPC cluster provides computational resources for intensive tasks such as:

- Scientific simulations
- Data analysis
- Machine learning workloads
- Parallel computing operations

## Documentation Structure

This repository is organized following a clear, intuitive structure:
